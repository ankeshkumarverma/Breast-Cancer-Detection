# Breast-Cancer-Detection
To create an ML model to classify malignant and benign tumor by extracting in given
past data of breast cancer patient cells and normal person cells and to predict the
type of cancer. To complete this ML project we are using the supervised machine
learning classifier algorithm.

# Dataset
We are loading breast cancer data using a sk-learn load_brast_cancer class.

# Modules Used
 Pandas: It is used for analyzing the data.
 NumPy: NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing package.
 Matplotlib: It is a numerical mathematics extension Numpy.

# Implementation
 Importing libraries
 Understanding database
 Data cleaning and formatting
 Data Analysis & Pre-processing
 Split DataFrame in train, validation and testing
 Feature Scaling
 Using Sequential Model for classification & accuracy
 Training the model by 500 rows of data
 Validation the model by 35 rows of data
 Testing the model to match the result with 34 rows of data (Cross-validation
of the ML model)
